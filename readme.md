Hello!
This is my attempt on recreating Pazaak cardgame from Star Wars franchise. 

The point of the game is to gain 20 points. In each turn you draw a card from the pool with random number 1-10.
You can also use plus and minus cards in your handdeck. 
If you receive >20 points, you lose. 

Currently the game can:
-Generate cards from the stack
-Output cards on the DOM
-Opponent can use +/- cards

WIP:
-Standing the game
-Adding more variaty of handdeck cards.
